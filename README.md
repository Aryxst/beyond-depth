I created this repository because there is currently no direct way to contribute to the development of the [Beyond Depth][MODPACK_LINK] modpack. All rights are reserved to [Blueversal][MODPACK_CREATOR_LINK], the creator of the modpack. I am simply tracking the changes on CurseForge, syncing them on this repository, making release tags, and adding my own custom contributions. It would be great if Blueversal (the owner of Beyond Depth) could create a repository similar to this one, fork it, or if I could transfer ownership of the repository
